This notebook is designed to showcase the capabilities of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, highlighting its integration with transformer models and the process of saving these models in a database. The task involves employing prompt engineering techniques, comparing the outcomes based on different prompts, and ultimately demonstrating the system's functionality through a deployed application using Gradio. For this project, I chose an introductory book on machine learning as my primary source. This book was first processed, then vectorized, and subsequently stored in a database utilizing ChromaDB. I employed the LLama GPTQ model to conduct queries, aiming to retrieve relevant information from the database. By experimenting with various prompting techniques using the same set of three questions, I observed how the model's performance varied. The culmination of this project was the deployment of the RAG system on Gradio, showcasing our preferred prompt choice and demonstrating the system's ability to leverage deep learning insights effectively.
